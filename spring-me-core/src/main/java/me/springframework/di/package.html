      An abstraction of a network of wired objects. We needed our own,
      since Spring's BeanDefinition's don't work well with
      SpringTemplate, and because we need additional information not
      provided by BeanDefinitions. Apart from that, having a dedicated
      abstraction allows us to pull the configuration from other
      sources as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {@link me.springframework.di.Instance Instance} models the
      <em>definition</em> of an object instance. Instances are
      configured through constructor arguments or property
      setters. The {@link me.springframework.di.Instance Instance} provides
      access to the configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Property setters and constructor arguments are both {@link
      me.springframework.di.Sink Sinks}. That is, they can be connected to
      {@link me.springframework.di.Source Sources}. There are different types
      of sources. The source can be an anonymous instance, a reference
      to a named instance, a list of objects, or just the String
      representation of a value.
