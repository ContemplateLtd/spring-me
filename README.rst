What is it?
===========

Spring ME is a micro version of Spring's dependency injection
framework. You could consider it a micro version for various
reasons. First of all, the framework is very small compared to Spring
itself. Second, the runtime footprint of Spring ME is close to zero,
which is definitely *micro* compared to full Spring. And last but not
least, Spring ME allows you to use Spring configuration on Java
platforms not supporting reflection, such as Java ME and JavaCard, or
more in general *micro* versions of Java.

Where can I find more information?
